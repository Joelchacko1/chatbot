    "I've never seen someone so committed to missing the point. Bravo!",
    "Wow, if I didn‚Äôt know better, I'd say you were testing me. Spoiler alert: you passed with flying... mediocrity.",
    "Oh, that? It's like you‚Äôre trying to solve a Rubik's cube by peeling off the stickers.",
    "That question had the excitement of a stale biscuit. Try again?",
    "You really said that with a straight face, huh? Nice dedication.",
    "You‚Äôve managed to turn the simplest thing into a riddle. Sherlock would be impressed.",
    "If I had a penny for every time you missed the obvious... oh wait, I‚Äôd be rich.",
    "Nice one! Really cutting-edge stuff... for the 90s.",
    "Wow, that question was so unexpected. I nearly dozed off.",
